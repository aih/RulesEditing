# RulesEditing
Based on [TrackWord](https://github.com/aih/TrackWord), this repository tracks one file ('Rules2012.docx'). At each commit, it creates a comparison document in MS Word, comparing the document at the previous commit. 
It also creates a changes.html file and an html version of the Comparison document, to show the document differences in a variety of formats. The changes can also be seen from the changes to Rules2012.md file in Github's commit view.
