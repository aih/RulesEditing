        chairman of the Republican Finance Committee shall be appointed
        pursuant to the provisions of Rule No. 5(c).

(b) The draft minutes of these committees shall be made available as
    promptly as practicable, with the final minutes available upon

    an equal number of men and women.

(d) Whenever a committee is appointed pursuant to Rule No. 10(c), the
    committee shall consist of a chairman, who shall be a member of the
    Republican National Committee, and of other appointees, at least
    half of whom shall be members of the Republican National Committee.

(e) All committees appointed and/or elected pursuant to any of these
    rules, except convention committees, may meet by telephone
    conference call with twenty-four (24) hours notice from the chairman
    of the Republican National Committee or the committee’s chairman.

(f) All committees appointed and/or elected pursuant to any of these
    rules, whether separately incorporated and whether a separate
    reporting entity, shall be under the supervision, direction, and
    control of the Republican National Committee, and its officers and
    staff, and shall be subject to and comply with the rules, policies
    and procedures of the Republican National Committee, including its
    budgetary review and approval process, financial controls, legal

    the Commission on Convention Planning, not to exceed twenty (20)
    members, to include the chairman and general counsel of the
    Republican National Committee who shall serve as ex officio members.
    The chairman of the Republican National Committee shall convene the
    Commission on Convention Planning as soon as practicable, but no
    later than January 31, 2013. This commission shall make any
    recommendations it deems appropriate and report such recommendations
    to the Republican National Committee at a Republican National
    Committee meeting held in conjunction with the 2014 State Chairmen’s
    Meeting to be held in the spring of 2014. The Commission on
    Convention Planning shall disband following the transmittal of
    its report. Necessary and proper resources of the Republican
    National Committee shall be made available to fund the efforts of

    four (4) regions shall elect two (2) members, one man and one woman,
    at its regional caucus at the RNC Summer Meeting in each
    even-numbered year in which no Presidential election is held. The
    chairman of the Republican National Committee shall appoint the

    from among the members thereof. The Standing Committee on
    Presidential Primary Debates shall have the authority to sanction
    debates on behalf of the Republican National Committee based on
    input from presidential campaigns and criteria which may include but
    are not limited to considerations of timing, frequency, format,
    media outlet, and the best interests of the Republican Party. Each
    debate sanctioned by the Standing Committee on Presidential Primary
    Debates shall be known as a "Sanctioned Debate." Any presidential
    candidate who participates in any debate that is not a Sanctioned
    Debate shall not be eligible to participate in any further
    Sanctioned Debates.

##### RULE NO. 11 Candidate Support

(a) The Republican National Committee shall not, without the prior
    written and filed approval of all members of the Republican National
    Committee from the state involved, contribute money or in-kind aid
    to any candidate for any public or party office of that state except
    the nominee of the Republican Party or a candidate who is unopposed
    in the Republican primary after the filing deadline for that office.
    In those states where state law establishes a non-partisan primary
    in which Republican candidates could participate, but in which the
    general election may not include a Republican candidate, the
    candidate endorsed by a convention held under the authority of the
    state Republican Party shall be recognized by the Republican
    National Committee as the Republican nominee.

(b) No state Republican Party rule or state law shall be observed that
    allows persons who have participated or are participating in the
    selection of any nominee of a party other than the Republican Party,
    including, but not limited to, through the use of a multi-party
    primary or similar type ballot, to participate in the selection of a
    nominee of the Republican Party for that general election. No person
    nominated in violation of this rule shall be recognized by the
    Republican National Committee as the nominee of the Republican Party
    from that state.

##### RULE NO. 12 Amendments

The Republican National Committee may, by three-fourths (3/4) vote of
its entire membership, amend Rule Nos. 1-11 and 13-25. Any such
amendment shall be considered by the Republican National Committee only
if it was passed by a majority vote of the Standing Committee on Rules
after having been submitted in writing at least ten (10) days in advance
of its consideration by the Republican National Committee and shall take
effect thirty (30) days after adoption. No such amendment shall be
adopted after September 30, 2014.

        to sixty percent (60%) of the number of electoral votes of that
        state; provided, however, that if Puerto Rico shall become a
        state prior to the next national convention, it shall be
        presumed that it would have cast its electoral votes, or a

        increased to the next whole number.)

    6.  In addition, one (1) delegate at large shall be awarded to a
        state for any and each of the following public officials elected

        ii. Membership in the Republican Party of at least
            one-half (1/2) of the representatives representing a state
            in the United States House of Representatives; provided that

            Republicans; provided that no such additional delegate at
            large awarded to any state shall exceed one (1);

        iv. Membership in the Republican Party of a majority of all
            chambers of a state legislature, if all such chambers are

            delegate at large awarded to any state shall exceed one (1);

    7.  In addition, one (1) delegate at large shall be awarded to a
        state for any and each Republican United States Senator elected
        by such state in the six (6) year period prior to January 1 of
        the year in which the next national convention is held; provided
        that no such additional delegate at large awarded to any state
        shall exceed two (2);

    8.  In addition, if the District of Columbia shall have cast its
        electoral votes, or a majority thereof, for the Republican
        nominee for President of the United States in the last preceding
        presidential election: four and one-half (4 1/2) delegates at
        large plus the number of delegates at large equal to thirty
        percent (30%) of the sixteen (16) delegates at large allotted to
        the District of Columbia. In the computation of the number of
        delegates at large, any sum of the four and one-half (4 1/2)
        plus the thirty percent (30%) representing a fraction shall be
        increased to the next whole number.

(b) Alternate Delegates. One (1) alternate delegate for each delegate to
    the national convention, except that no alternates shall be selected
    for Republican National Committee members.

(c) Any state Republican Party may set the date for any primary, caucus,
    convention, or meeting for the purpose of voting for a presidential
    candidate and/or electing, selecting, allocating, or binding
    delegates to the national convention subject to the scheduling
    provisions in Rule No. 16. To the extent a state Republican Party’s
    rules are in conflict with its state’s laws with respect to this
    rule, the provisions of this rule and the state Republican Party’s
    rules shall control. To the extent the provisions of the rule are
    inconsistent with the provisions of Rule No. 16, the provisions of
    this rule shall be controlling for all purposes.

##### RULE NO. 15 Participation in the Delegate Selection Process

(a) The states, in cooperation with the Republican National Committee,
    shall prepare instructive material on delegate election, selection,
    allocation, or binding methods and make it available
    for distribution.

(b) Participation in a Republican primary, caucus, or any meeting or
    convention held for the purpose of electing, selecting, allocating,
    or binding delegates and alternate delegates to a county, district,
    state, or national convention shall in no way be abridged for
    reasons of sex, race, religion, color, age, or national origin. The
    Republican National Committee and the state Republican Party or
    governing committee of each state shall take positive action to
    achieve the broadest possible participation by men and women, young
    people, minority and heritage groups, senior citizens, and all other
    citizens in the delegate election, selection, allocation, or
    binding process.

(c) Unless otherwise provided by the laws of the state in which the
    election occurs, in those states where delegates and alternate
    delegates are elected through the convention system or a combination
    of convention and primary systems, the precinct, ward, township, or
    county meetings shall be open meetings and all citizens who are
    qualified shall be urged to participate.

(d) Each state shall endeavor to have equal representation of men and
    women in its delegation to the Republican National Convention.

(e) The provisions of these rules are not intended to be the basis of
    any kind of quota system.

##### RULE NO. 16 Election, Selection, Allocation, or Binding of Delegates and Alternate Delegates

(a) Binding and Allocation.

    1.  Any statewide presidential preference vote that permits a choice
        among candidates for the Republican nomination for President of
        the United States in a primary, caucuses, or a state convention
        must be used to allocate and bind the state’s delegation to the
        national convention in either a proportional or winner-take-all
        manner, except for delegates and alternate delegates who appear
        on a ballot in a statewide election and are elected directly by
        primary voters.

    2.  The Secretary of the Convention shall faithfully announce and
        record each delegate’s vote in accordance with the delegate’s
        obligation under these rules, state law or state party rule. If
        any delegate bound by these rules, state party rule or state law
        to vote for a presidential candidate at the national convention
        demonstrates support under Rule 40 for any person other than the
        candidate to whom he or she is bound, such support shall not
        be recognized. Except as provided for by state law or state
        party rule, no presidential candidate shall have the power to
        remove a delegate.

(b) Order of Precedence. Delegates at large and their alternate
    delegates and delegates from Congressional districts and their
    alternate delegates to the national convention shall be elected,
    selected, allocated, or bound in the following manner:

    1.  In accordance with any applicable Republican Party rules of a
        state, insofar as the same are not inconsistent with these
        rules; or

    2.  To the extent not provided for in the applicable Republican
        Party rules of a state, in accordance with any applicable laws
        of a state, insofar as the same are not inconsistent with these
        rules; or

    3.  By a combination of the methods set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)
        or (b)(2) of this rule; or

    4.  To the extent not provided by state law or party rules, as set
        forth in paragraph (e) of this rule.

(c) Timing and Allocation.

    1.  No primary, caucus, convention, or other process to elect,
        select, allocate, or bind delegates to the national convention
        shall occur prior to March 1 or after the second Saturday in
        June in the year in which a national convention is held. Except
        Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada may conduct
        their processes no earlier than one month before the next
        earliest state in the year in which a national convention is
        held and shall not be subject to the provisions of
        paragraph (c)(2) of this rule.

    2.  Any presidential primary, caucus, convention, or other process
        to elect, select, allocate, or bind delegates to the national
        convention that occurs prior to March 15 in the year in which
        the national convention is held shall provide for the allocation
        of delegates on a proportional basis.

    3.  Proportional allocation of total delegates as required by
        Rule 16(c)(2) shall be based upon the number of statewide votes
        cast or the number of congressional district votes cast in
        proportion to the number of votes received by each candidate.

        i.  A state may establish by statewide vote or by congressional
            district a minimum threshold of the percentage of votes
            received by a candidate that must be reached below which a
            candidate may receive no delegates, provided such threshold
            is no higher than twenty percent (20%).

        ii. A state may establish by statewide vote or by congressional
            district a minimum threshold of the percentage of votes
            received by a candidate that must be reached above which the
            candidate may receive all the delegates, provided such
            threshold is no lower than fifty percent (50%).

(d) General. In all elections or selections of delegates or alternate
    delegates to the national convention, the following rules shall
    apply:

    1.  Delegates and alternate delegates to the national convention may
        be elected, selected, allocated, or bound only in one of the
        following manners:

        i.  by primary election;

        ii. by the Republican state committee, where specifically
            provided by state law;

        iii. by state and Congressional district conventions;

        iv. by any method consistent with these rules by which delegates
            and alternate delegates were elected, selected, allocated,
            or bound to the most recent Republican National Convention
            from that state;

        v.  by Rule No. 14 (a)(2) of these rules.

    2.  Only persons eligible to vote who are deemed as a matter of
        public record to be Republicans pursuant to state law or, if
        voters are not enrolled by party, by Republican Party rules of a
        state, shall participate in any primary election held for the
        purpose of electing delegates or alternate delegates to the
        national convention or in any Republican caucus, mass meeting,
        or mass convention held for the purpose of selecting delegates
        to the county, district, or state conventions, and only such
        legal and qualified voters shall be elected as delegates to
        county, district, and state conventions; provided, however, that
        in addition to the qualifications provided herein, the
        applicable Republican Party rules of a state may prescribe
        additional qualifications not inconsistent with law, which
        additional qualifications shall be adopted before October 1 in
        the year before the year in which the national convention is to
        be held and published in at least one (1) newspaper having a
        general circulation throughout the state, such publication to be
        at least ninety (90) days before such qualifications
        become effective.

    3.  No state law shall be observed that permits any person to
        participate in a primary delegate and alternate delegate
        selection process that also permits that person at the same
        primary to participate in the choosing of nominees of any other
        party for other elective office. Delegates and alternate
        delegates to the national convention shall in that event be
        selected pursuant to state Republican Party rules that are not
        inconsistent with The Rules of the Republican Party; provided,
        however, that the selection process established by the state
        Republican Party rules shall provide that only persons eligible
        to vote who are deemed to be Republicans pursuant to state law
        or state Republican Party rules shall participate in such
        delegate election or selection process.

    4.  In any jurisdiction in which Republican representation upon the
        board of judges or inspectors of elections for primary elections
        is denied by law, delegates and alternate delegates shall be
        elected as provided in paragraph (b) of this rule.

    5.  In electing or selecting delegates and alternate delegates to
        the national convention, no state law shall be observed which
        hinders, abridges, or denies to any citizen of the United
        States, eligible under the Constitution of the United States to
        hold the office of President of the United States or Vice
        President of the United States, the right or privilege of being
        a candidate under such state law for the nomination for
        President of the United States or Vice President of the United
        States or which authorizes the election or selection of a number
        of delegates or alternate delegates from any state to the
        national convention different from that fixed in these rules.

    6.  Alternate delegates shall be elected to the national convention
        for each unit of representation equal in number to the number of
        delegates elected therein and shall be chosen in the same manner
        and at the same time as the delegates and under the same rules;
        provided, however, that if the law of any state shall prescribe
        another method of choosing alternate delegates, they may be
        chosen in accordance with the provisions of the law of the state
        in which the election occurs, except that no alternates shall be
        selected for Republican National Committee members.

    7.  Any process authorized or implemented by a state Republican
        Party for selecting delegates and alternate delegates or for
        binding the presidential preference of such delegates shall use
        every means practicable to guarantee the right of active duty
        military personnel and individuals unable to attend meetings due
        to injuries suffered in military service the opportunity to
        exercise their right to vote in that process. This rule is not
        intended to and shall not prevent a state from using a caucus or
        convention process that may or may not elect presidential
        delegates or alternates.

    8.  Delegates and alternate delegates at large to the national
        convention when serving as delegates and alternate delegates
        shall be residents of and duly qualified voters in their
        respective states. All delegates and alternate delegates
        allocated as delegates and alternate delegates at large shall be
        elected at large in the several states.

    9.  Delegates and alternate delegates to the national convention
        representing Congressional districts shall be residents of and
        qualified voters in said districts respectively when elected and
        when serving as delegates and alternate delegates. There shall
        be three (3) delegates and three (3) alternate delegates
        allocated to represent each Congressional district of the
        several states, who shall be elected by each such
        Congressional district.

    10. No delegate or alternate delegate, or candidate for delegate or
        alternate delegate, to the national convention shall be required
        to pay an assessment or fee in excess of that provided by the
        law of the state in which his or her election or selection
        occurs as a condition of standing for election or serving as a
        delegate or alternate delegate to the national convention.

    11. There shall be no automatic delegates to the national convention
        who serve by virtue of party position or elective office, except
        as provided for in Rule No. 14(a)(2).

    12. No delegates or alternate delegates shall be elected, selected,
        allocated, or bound pursuant to any Republican Party rule of a
        state or state law which materially changes the manner of
        electing, selecting, allocating, or binding delegates or
        alternate delegates or the date upon which such state Republican
        Party holds a presidential primary, caucus, convention, or
        meeting for the purpose of voting for a presidential candidate
        and/or electing, selecting, allocating, or binding delegates to
        the national convention if such changes were adopted or made
        effective after October 1 of the year before the year in which
        the national convention is to be held. Where it is not possible
        for a state Republican Party to certify the manner and the date
        upon which it holds a presidential primary, caucus, convention,
        or meeting for the purpose of voting for a presidential
        candidate and/or electing, selecting, allocating, or binding
        delegates to the national convention in effect in that state on
        the date and in the manner provided in paragraph (f) of this
        rule, the process for holding the presidential primary, caucus,
        convention, or meeting for the purpose of voting for a
        presidential candidate and/or electing, selecting, allocating,
        or binding delegates to the national convention shall be
        conducted in the same manner and held upon the same date as was
        used for the immediately preceding national convention. If it is
        not possible to hold a presidential primary, caucus, convention,
        or meeting for the purpose of voting for a presidential
        candidate and/or electing, selecting, allocating, or binding
        delegates to the national convention upon the same date as was
        used for the immediately preceding national convention, then
        delegates or alternate delegates shall be elected or selected by
        Congressional district or state conventions pursuant to
        paragraph (e) of this rule.

(e) Conventions. Wherever state law permits or the Republican Party
    rules of a state require the election of delegates and alternate
    delegates by convention or there is no applicable state law or
    Republican Party rule, delegates and alternate delegates to the
    national convention shall be elected by Congressional district or
    state conventions pursuant to the following rules:

    1.  Congressional district or state conventions shall be called by
        the Republican state committee.

    2.  Delegates to Congressional district conventions may be elected
        in precinct caucuses, mass meetings, mass conventions, or county
        conventions in which only eligible voters in such precinct,

        Republican Party from the provisions of Rule Nos. 16(a)(1)
        and (2) where compliance is impossible and the Republican

        the best interests of the Republican Party.

##### RULE NO. 17 Enforcement of Rules

(a) If any state or state Republican Party violates Rule No. 16(c)(2),
    the number of delegates and the number of alternate delegates to the
    national convention from that state shall each be reduced by fifty
    percent (50%). Any sum presenting a fraction shall be decreased to
    the next whole number. No delegation shall be reduced to less than
    two (2) delegates and a corresponding number of alternate delegates.
    If any state or state Republican Party violates Rule No. 16(c)(1) of
    The Rules of the Republican Party the number of delegates to the
    national convention shall be reduced for those states with 30 or
    more total delegates to nine (9) plus the members of the Republican
    National Committee from that state, and for those sates with 29 or
    fewer total delegates to six (6) plus the members of the Republican
    National Committee from that state. The corresponding alternate
    delegates shall also be reduced accordingly.

(b) If any state or state Republican Party violates Rule No. 16(c)(2) of
    The Rules of the Republican Party, the Republican National
    Convention shall provide for the allocation of the selected at large
    delegates (excluding members of the Republican National Committee)
    among the candidates who received more than 10% of the votes cast in
    such primary, convention or caucus in accordance with and in
    proportion to the votes cast for each such candidate as a part of
    the total of the votes cast for all such candidates in that primary,
    convention, or caucus.

(c) If a violation has occurred before the issuance of the call to the
    national convention, the chairman of the Republican National
    Committee shall notify the offending state of the violation and
    shall inform the state of the number of delegates and alternate
    delegates it will lose as well as, if the state has violated
    Rule No. 16(c)(2), that its delegates will be allocated in
    accordance with Rule No. 17(b). The reduced number of delegates and
    alternate delegates as well as, if applicable, the delegates
    allocated in direct proportion to votes received will be reflected
    in the call to the national convention, and will be reported to the
    secretary of state or responsible election official of the offending
    state and to the chairman of every state Republican Party. Said
    reduced number will be the only number recognized as the official
    delegation of the state to the national convention.

(d) If a violation has occurred after the issuance of the call to the
    national convention, the chairman of the Republican National
    Committee shall notify the state of the violation and shall inform
    the state of the number of delegates and alternate delegates it will
    lose, as well as, if applicable, that the delegates will be
    allocated in direct proportion to votes received. This reduced
    number of delegates and alternate delegates, as well as, if
    applicable, the delegates allocated in direct proportion to votes
    received, will be reported to the secretary of state or responsible
    election official of the offending state and to the chairman of
    every state Republican Party, and such reduced number will be the
    only number recognized as the official delegation of the state to
    the national convention.

(e) If the chairman of the Republican National Committee does not act
    upon a violation of Rule No. 16(c) of The Rules of the Republican
    Party, then a statement may be filed against a state or state
    Republican Party by any three (3) members of the Republican National
    Committee Standing Committee on Rules who feel that a violation
    has occurred.

    1.  A statement filed against a state or state Republican Party by
        any three (3) members of the Standing Committee on Rules shall
        be written and shall specify the reasons why the members believe
        the state or state Republican Party is in violation. The
        statement shall be signed and dated by each Standing Committee
        on Rules member filing the statement, and shall be filed with
        the secretary of the Republican National Committee. The
        secretary of the Republican National Committee shall, within
        twenty (20) days of receipt, distribute such statement to all
        members of the Republican National Committee.

    2.  The Standing Committee on Rules shall meet upon the call of the
        chairman of the Rules Committee and shall vote upon whether a
        state or state Republican Party is in violation. If by majority
        vote the Standing Committee on Rules finds a violation,
        paragraphs (a) and (b) of this rule will be imposed.

(f) A state or state Republican Party shall have no appeal from either a
    finding of a violation against it or a penalty imposed upon it under
    this rule.

##### RULE NO. 18 Vacancies in a State Delegation

(a) Where the rules adopted by a state Republican Party provide a method
    for filling vacancies in its national convention delegation, they
    shall be filled pursuant to such method.

(b) Where the rules adopted by a state Republican Party do not provide a
    method for filling vacancies in its national convention delegation,
    and where the state laws do provide such a method of replacement,
    they shall be filled pursuant to such method provided by state laws.

(c) Where neither the rules adopted by a state Republican Party nor
    state laws provide a method for filling vacancies in its national
    convention delegation, the state Republican Party should make every
    effort to elect those individuals filling the vacancies in the
    delegation in the same manner as the delegates were originally
    elected or selected, or by vote of the state Republican Party
    executive committee or if the state executive committee has not
    filled the vacancy by ten (10) days prior to the convention, by vote
    of the state delegation. This section shall not apply to the
    delegates allocated to the state in Rule No. 14(a)(2).

##### RULE NO. 19 Excess Delegates and Alternate Delegates

(a) No state shall elect or select a greater number of persons to act as
    delegates and alternate delegates than the actual number of
    delegates and alternate delegates, respectively, to which it is
    entitled under the call for the national convention, including any
    Rule No. 17 penalties. No unit of representation may elect or select
    any delegate or alternate delegate with permission to cast a
    fractional vote.

(b) Where more than the authorized number of delegates from any state is
    certified and forwarded to the secretary of the Republican National
    Committee in the manner provided in Rule No. 20, a contest shall be
    deemed to exist and the secretary shall notify the several claimants
    so reported and shall submit all such credentials and claims to the

    claimants reported shall be placed upon the temporary roll of the
    national convention.

        chairman and secretary of such convention or by the chairman and
        secretary of the Republican state committee, and forwarded to
        the secretary of the Republican National Committee;

    2.  In every case where they are elected by primary, by the
        canvassing board or officer created or designated by the law of
        the state in which the election occurs, to canvass the returns
        and issue certificates of election to delegates or alternate
        delegates to national conventions of political parties, and all
        certificates shall be forwarded by the chairman and secretary of
        the Republican Party for the state in which the election is held
        to the secretary of the Republican National Committee; and

    3.  In every case where they are elected or selected by the
        Republican state committee, by the chairman and secretary of the
        Republican state committee, and forwarded to the secretary of
        the Republican National Committee.

    meeting of the national convention, the credentials of each delegate
    and alternate delegate shall be filed with the secretary of the
    Republican National Committee for use by the secretary in making up
    the temporary roll of the national convention, except in the case of
    delegates or alternate delegates elected at a time or times in
    accordance with the laws of the state in which the election occurs
    rendering impossible the filing of credentials within the time
    above specified.

(d) The Executive Committee of the Republican National Committee may
    grant a waiver to a state Republican Party that is out of compliance
    with the deadlines imposed by Rule 20 as of the date the start of
    the convention is set and, where, after reasonable efforts were made
    to comply, the state as of the date set forth in Rule 16(f)(1)
    remains out of compliance with the deadlines imposed by Rule 20 and
    the Executive Committee of the Republican National Committee
    determines that such a waiver is in the best interests of the
    Republican Party. Notwithstanding the above, if reasonable efforts
    to change the law are impracticable due to non-Republican control
    over the governmental entity with the authority to set the date for
    the delegate selection process then a waiver shall be granted.

##### RULE NO. 21 Contests: Resolution by States

All contests arising in any state electing district delegates by
district conventions shall be decided by its state convention or, if the
state convention shall not meet prior to the national convention, then
by its state committee. Only contests affecting delegates elected or
selected at large shall be presented to the Republican National
Committee; provided, however, if the contest regarding a district
delegate arises out of irregular or unlawful action of the state

    contest as to such person has been finally decided and such person
    has been permanently seated, except that any such person may be
    accorded the right to so vote, except in matters involving the
    credentials of that person, by an affirmative vote of a majority of
    the members of the Republican National Committee or the Convention
    Committee on Credentials.

##### RULE NO. 24 Contest Procedure

(a) The Standing Committee on Contests shall have the power to adopt
    procedural rules, not inconsistent with these rules, which shall
    govern the expeditious resolution of contests before the Standing
    Committee on Contests. When any deadline set out in this rule falls
    on a Sunday or legal holiday, such deadline shall be extended to the
    following day.

(b) No later than twenty-two (22) days before the convening of the

    Position in support of the party’s claim to sit as delegates or
    alternate delegates to the national convention together with such
    affidavits or other evidence as desired, and simultaneously send a

    with a summary of not more than one thousand (1,000) words setting
    forth succinctly a synopsis of the Statement of Position and a
    specific statement of the points relied upon. In the case of
    delegates or alternate delegates elected or selected at a time or
    times pursuant to a waiver granted under Rule No. 20(d) that makes
    compliance with any deadline set forth in this rule impossible, the
    Standing Committee on Contests shall, as soon as practicable after
    the filing of a notice under Rule No. 23, notify the parties to the
    affected contest of the deadline to file the Statement of Position.

(c) The Standing Committee on Contests shall promptly hear the matter;
    decide which issues are involved, either of law or fact, or both;
    decide upon its recommendation for resolution of such issues; and
    submit such issues and its recommendations for resolution to the
    Republican National Committee. The issues so submitted by the
    Standing Committee on Contests shall be the sole issues passed upon
    and determined by the Republican National Committee unless the
    Republican National Committee shall, by a majority vote, extend or
    change the same. If the Committee on Contests for any reason shall
    fail to state the issues either of law or fact, the Republican
    National Committee shall decide upon what issues the contest shall
    be tried, and the hearing shall be limited to such issues unless the
    Republican National Committee, by a majority vote, shall
    decide otherwise.

(d) The Standing Committee on Contests shall make up a Report of each
    contest filed, showing which issues are involved, either of law or
    fact, or both, and its recommendations to the Republican National
    Committee for resolution thereof. When the Standing Committee on
    Contests has prepared such Report, a copy shall be provided
    forthwith by the chairman of the Standing Committee on Contests to
    the parties by the most expeditious method available.

(e) The parties shall have eight (8) days to file written objections to
    the Standing Committee on Contests' Report, unless the Republican
    National Committee is called to act upon the contest sooner, in
    which case such objections shall be made before the meeting of the
    whole committee.

(f) When the Republican National Committee is called to pass upon any
    contest that may arise, the members of the Convention Committee on
    Credentials shall also be notified of the time and place of such
    meeting and shall have the right to attend all hearings of all
    contests but without the right to participate in the discussion or
    the vote.

##### RULE NO. 25 Convention Committee on Credentials

(a) When the national convention shall have assembled, the secretary of
    the Republican National Committee shall deliver to the Convention
    Committee on Credentials all credentials and other papers forwarded
    under Rule No. 20(c).

    from any ruling of the Republican National Committee on any contest,
    by and only by a party to such contest in the proceedings conducted
    pursuant to Rule Nos. 23 and 24; provided, however, that notice of
    such appeal must be filed with the secretary of the Republican
    National Committee no later than six (6) hours prior to the
    convening of the Temporary Convention Committee on Credentials. This
    notice shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is taken.
    Only the grounds so specified shall be heard by the Convention
    Committee on Credentials upon such appeal. No evidence other than
    that taken before the Republican National Committee shall be taken
    up by the Convention Committee on Credentials unless it shall, by a
    majority vote of its members present and voting, so direct.

(c) No issue involving the status of one or more delegates or alternate
    delegates or any contest relating thereto may originate before the
    Convention Committee on Credentials of the national convention. All
    contests must first be presented to the Standing Committee on
    Contests of the Republican National Committee or to the whole
    Republican National Committee in the manner provided in Rule No.
    19(b).

(d) No motion with respect to delegates or alternate delegates from more
    than one (1) state or territory shall be in order before the

    votes for each candidate whose name was presented in accordance with

    the convention.

    each of the committees constituted when notice of election of at
    least fifty percent (50%) of its members has been filed in

    letter shall be attached to the document stating that all proposed
    rules are still subject to change prior to the meeting of the
